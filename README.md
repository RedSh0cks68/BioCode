# BioCode
BioCode is a Python library that is a work in progress, and is a form of me using my biology research and putting it into one of my main hobbies, programming. BioCode is a way to learn Biology using Python code and maybe eventually C and C++. This project is a work in progress. I am open to suggestions and for people to edit the file in any way


DO NOT USE THIS README FOR REFERENCE TO USE THE CODE***
THIS IS NOT A CODE REFERENCE, THIS ONLY GIVES INFO ON THE PROJECT***



Basic lib Specs:
Current version installed: Biocode V 0.1.0
Coded in Python
Status: Early development / stable (mostly)
Primary focus: Genetics, biological modeling, and visualization.

BioCode is for programmers who have the same interests as me.

Biological science

It is a library designed to help programmers learn biology by putting it in code.

**I do not recommend using this for full-fledged biology projects until it is in later stages of development**


Biocode is currently "Open source" to an extent. Please reach out to me if you want to add things. I will mention you in the next release


SINCE BIOCODE IS EARLY:

expect:

Breaking changes, experimental features, and incomplete documentation

Currently looking for Bug Hunters for my code. If you find any, feel free to reach out!
