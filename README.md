# BioCode
BioCode is a Python library that is a work in progress, and is a fomr of me using my biology research and putting it into one of my main hobbies, programming. BioCode is a way to learn Biology using Python code and maybe eventually C and C++. This project is a work in progress, I am open for suggestions, and for people to edit the file in anyway!
